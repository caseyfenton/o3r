### Creating and Distributing Chrome Apps for Specific URLs in 2025

In 2025, Chrome Apps are deprecated, and developers are advised to transition to Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) or Chrome Extensions. Chrome Extensions are better suited for enhancing browser functionality and interacting with specific URLs. Below are the steps:

---

### **1. Develop a Chrome Extension**
1. **Project Setup**:
   - Create a project folder containing essential files: `manifest.json`, HTML, JavaScript, and assets[10].
   - Structure should include a manifest file for metadata (name, version, permissions)[10].

2. **Define Permissions**:
   - Specify permissions in `manifest.json`, including access to specific URLs (`<all_urls>` or URL patterns)[10].

3. **Core Functionality**:
   - Use `content_scripts` for interacting with specific pages.
   - Leverage background scripts for persistent tasks or API calls[10].

4. **Extension APIs**:
   - Utilize APIs like `chrome.tabs` or `chrome.webRequest` to control behavior on specific URLs[6].

---

### **2. Testing and Optimization**
- Test the extension thoroughly in Chrome browser.
- Use tools like Chrome DevTools for debugging and performance optimization[10].

---

### **3. Publishing the Extension**
1. **To Chrome Web Store**:
   - Package the extension as a `.zip` file.
   - Upload to the Chrome Web Store, adhering to guidelines like the "single purpose" policy[6][10].

2. **Self-Hosting**:
   - Provide the extension's XML manifest URL for manual installation, mainly for managed devices in enterprises or schools[6].

---

### **4. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) Alternative**
- PWAs are recommended for URL-specific web apps.
- Enhance functionality by pairing PWAs with extensions, if necessary[1][6].

---

### **5. Distribution and Administration**
1. **Chrome Web Store**:
   - Extensions can be distributed widely or restricted to specific users/domains[6].

2. **Managed Environments**:
   - Administrators can force-install extensions via policy settings in the Google Admin Console[6][5].

3. **Testing with Firebase**:
   - Utilize Firebase App Distribution to provide pre-release versions to testers for feedback[2][3].

---

### **6. Migration from Chrome Apps**
- Developers migrating from Chrome Apps must guide users to uninstall the old apps and adopt new solutions like extensions or PWAs[1][5].
- Managed policies (e.g., `ExtensionInstallForceList`) should be updated for enterprises[1].

---

### Notes:
- Chrome Apps will reach their final phase-out by 2028, with key deadlines in 2025 for ChromeOS support[1][5].
- Extensions should align with modern web standards and security practices to ensure compatibility and efficiency[10].
