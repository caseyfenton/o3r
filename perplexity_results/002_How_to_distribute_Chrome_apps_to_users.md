### Distribution of Chrome Apps and Extensions

#### **Chrome Web Store**
1. **Standard Publishing**:
   - Publish apps/extensions via the Chrome Web Store.
   - Visibility options: Public, Unlisted, or Private.
   - Extensions must pass a review process before publication, which can take several days[1][8].

2. **Private Distribution**:
   - Restrict app visibility to specific users or organizations.
   - Admins can deploy private apps/extensions to organizational units via the Google Admin Console[1][8].

3. **Updates**:
   - Automatic updates for apps/extensions are handled through the Chrome Web Store[1].

#### **Self-Hosting**
1. **Hosting Extensions**:
   - Host Chrome extensions on private servers.

3. **Advantages**:
   - Full control over distribution and updates.
   - Immediate availability of updates bypassing Chrome Web Store review[1][5].

#### **Enterprise Distribution**
1. **Google Admin Console**:
   - Admins can force-install apps/extensions across managed devices.
   - Extensions are added using their Web Store IDs[1][8].

2. **Policy Management**:
   - Use Group Policy Objects (Windows) or JSON configuration files for centralized control[2][5].

3. **Version Control**:

   - Web apps can be distributed via a URL and accessed in Chrome.

   - Developers can create beta testing tracks for app versions.
   - Useful for internal testing before public release[7].

2. **Managed Play Store Integration**:

These methods ensure flexibility in distributing Chrome apps and extensions to various user groups, from individual users to large organizations.
