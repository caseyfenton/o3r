### Chrome Protocol Handlers vs. Web App Installation: Key Differences and Features

**Chrome Protocol Handlers**
- Allow websites or PWAs to register as handlers for specific URL schemes using `registerProtocolHandler()` or the `protocol_handlers` field in the manifest[1][4][7].
- Protocols can include predefined schemes (e.g., `mailto`, `bitcoin`) or custom schemes prefixed with `web+` or `ext+`[1][7][10].
- Upon registration, clicking an associated link opens the PWA or site, passing the URL as a parameter[4][7][10].
- Registration enhances integration with operating systems by associating the app with specific protocols in app preferences[4][10].
- Security requirements include HTTPS URLs and safelisted protocols or custom schemes conforming to specific rules[1][10].
- Protocol handlers are optional and require explicit user action for activation[1][4][10].

**Web App Installation (PWAs)**
- PWAs can be promoted for installation by browsers if they meet installability criteria (e.g., valid manifest, HTTPS, service worker)[2][5].
- Installed PWAs appear as standalone apps with icons in the operating system, offering behavior akin to native apps[2][5].
- Installation triggers vary by browser and platform (e.g., "Install" icon in Chrome, "Add to Home Screen" on Android)[2][8].
- Once installed, PWAs can run offline, access system features like notifications, and work independently of the browser[2][5].
- Developers can customize the installation prompt using manifest fields like `description`, `screenshots`, and `name`[2][8].
- Installation provides users with enhanced discoverability and usability, functioning as a bridge between web and native apps[2][8].

**Comparison Table**

| Feature                         | Protocol Handlers                                         | Web App Installation (PWA)                          |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                     | Handle specific URL schemes                              | Provide standalone app experience                   |
| **Integration**                 | Registers app with OS for protocol handling              | Installs app with OS integration (icons, launchers) |
| **Trigger**                     | User clicks a protocol-specific link                     | Browser prompts or user initiates installation      |
| **Customization**               | Protocols and handler URL defined in manifest            | Install prompt customizable via manifest fields     |
| **Security**                    | Requires HTTPS and safe/custom schemes                  | Requires HTTPS and valid manifest                  |
| **Offline Support**             | No                                                       | Yes (if implemented by developers)                 |
| **User Action**                 | Requires explicit user consent for registration          | Requires user confirmation for installation         |

### Summary
Protocol handlers focus on linking specific URL schemes to apps, enhancing integration for certain tasks. Web app installation elevates PWAs to function as standalone apps with broader system integration, offline access, and native-like behavior. Both features complement each other to extend the capabilities of web apps.
