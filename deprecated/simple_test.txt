### REFACTORING INSTRUCTIONS ###
Refactor this codebase to be more vertically compressed and efficient while maintaining functionality. Requirements:
1. Combine related functions, variables, and imports on single lines where logical
2. Use Python shorthand syntax (list/dict comprehensions, ternaries, etc.)
3. Merge similar logic and remove redundant code
4. CRITICAL: Preserve ALL literal strings exactly as-is, including:
   - Success messages
   - Error messages
   - API responses
   - Log messages
   - Test assertions
5. Preserve docstrings and comments that explain complex logic
6. Maintain the same imports, just organize them better

# O3R: Unleash the Power of O3 for Code Refactoring

**O3R** (pronounced "o-three-r") is a powerful utility that unlocks the full potential of OpenAI's O3 model for code refactoring, enhancement, and development. This tool bridges the gap between limited-context coding assistants and O3's massive context window capabilities.

## üöÄ Why O3R Changes the Game

Most coding assistants suffer from limited context windows, making it difficult to work with large codebases. O3R solves this problem by:

- **Leveraging O3's 200K token context window** - Process entire modules or projects at once
- **Utilizing O3's 100K output token capacity** - Get comprehensive rewrites and refactors in one shot
- **Automating the entire workflow** - From code preparation to response collection
- **Maximizing value from ChatGPT subscriptions** - O3 web interface charges per query/response, not per token

## üí° Use Cases

### Comprehensive Code Refactoring
Feed entire modules into O3 to:
- Modernize legacy codebases
- Apply consistent patterns across your project
- Convert between paradigms (e.g., OOP to functional)

### One-Shot Feature Implementation
Provide full context for more accurate feature additions:
- Add new functionality with complete understanding of your codebase
- Implement cross-cutting concerns correctly the first time
- Ensure new code follows existing patterns and conventions

### Deep Bug Fixing
Fix complex bugs that span multiple files:
- Include all relevant code paths in a single prompt
- Get fixes that address root causes, not just symptoms
- Debug issues that depend on interactions between components

### Code Quality Improvements
Enhance your entire codebase at once:
- Apply consistent formatting and style
- Improve performance bottlenecks
- Add proper error handling throughout
- Enhance documentation and type hints

## ‚ú® Features

- üîÑ **Smart Concatenation**: Combines source files with proper formatting and instructions
- üìé **Clipboard Integration**: Automatically copies prepared content
- üöÄ **Auto-Paste**: Opens O3 web app and pastes your code (optional)
- üìä **Response Monitoring**: Watches for when O3 completes its response (optional)
- üìã **Response Collection**: Extracts code from O3's response for easy integration
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable Process**: Supports various file types and configurations

## üí∞ Cost Efficiency

Using o3r with a ChatGPT subscription provides exceptional value:
- **Subscription-based pricing**: Pay a flat fee (e.g., $20/month) rather than per-token API costs
- **Unlimited queries**: Process large codebases without worrying about token costs
- **Avoid $1+ API charges**: A single large refactoring job via API could cost dollars per run

## üîß Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/caseyfenton/o3r.git
cd o3r

# Install globally
./install.sh
```

This will install the following commands:

- `o3r`: Main tool for preparing code for O3 refactoring
- `o3r-collect`: Tool for collecting responses from O3
- `o3r-monitor`: Tool for monitoring O3 for responses
- `o3r-run`: All-in-one background tool for the complete O3 workflow

### Chrome App Setup (Required for Auto-paste and Monitoring)

For the auto-paste and monitoring features to work reliably, you need to create a Chrome App for O3:

1. Open Chrome
2. Navigate to https://chat.openai.com/?model=o3-mini-high
3. Click menu (three dots) ‚Üí More tools ‚Üí Create shortcut
4. Check "Open as window" option
5. Name it "ChatGPT-o3-mini-high" (important to match exactly what the scripts look for)
6. Click Create

This creates a dedicated window that the scripts can reliably target for automation.

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Process all Python files in the current directory
o3r -d . -e py

# Process JavaScript and TypeScript files in the src directory
o3r -d ./src -e js,ts

# Process specific files listed in a text file
o3r -f my_files.txt
```

### Command Options Explained

The main command `o3r` takes the following options:

- `-d DIR` : **Directory** - Process all matching files in the specified directory (recursively)
- `-f FILE` : **File List** - Read list of files from the specified file
- `-e EXTS` : **Extensions** - Comma-separated list of file extensions to include (default: py,js,ts,go)
- `-o FILE` : **Output** - Write output to a file instead of clipboard
- `-p` : **Paste** - Auto-paste to O3 web app (Mac only)
- `-m` : **Monitor** - Auto-monitor for responses after submission (Mac only)
- `-i SECS` : **Interval** - Check interval for monitoring in seconds (default: 30)
- `-t SECS` : **Timeout** - Maximum wait time for monitoring in seconds (default: 300)

### Advanced Usage Examples

```bash
# Auto-paste to O3 web app
o3r -d ./src -e py -p

# Auto-paste AND monitor for responses
o3r -d ./src -e py -p -m

# Write output to a file instead of clipboard
o3r -d ./src -e py -o refactor_request.txt

# Set custom monitoring intervals (check every 10 seconds for 5 minutes)
o3r -d ./src -e py -p -m -i 10 -t 300

# Process multiple directories
o3r -d "src/core,tests" -e py

# Use with file list from standard input
echo -e "file1.py\nfile2.py" | o3r -f -
```

### Response Collection

Once your code has been processed by O3, you can collect the response using:

```bash
# Collect the full response from O3
o3r-collect collect

# Extract just the code blocks
o3r-collect code
```

## üöß Future Plans

This project is actively evolving with several enhancements planned:

### AI-Assisted File Selection

We're working on integrating intelligent file selection to automatically identify the most relevant files for refactoring:

- Use AI to analyze project structure and determine entry points
- Identify core files and dependencies based on import graphs
- Prioritize files based on complexity and refactoring potential
- Optimize token usage by focusing on the most impactful files

### Enhanced Workflow Integration

- Integration with popular IDEs and editors
- Support for diff-based application of changes
- Automatic test running after refactoring
- Version control integration
- Improved browser automation that doesn't rely on Chrome Apps
- Cross-platform window targeting for more reliable automation

### Additional Features

- Support for custom templates and prompt libraries
- Project configuration files for recurring refactoring tasks
- Expanded language support

### Automated Code Analysis

We're planning a continuous code analysis feature that leverages O3 to provide ongoing insights about your codebase:

- **Background Monitoring**: Automatically analyze your code on schedule or when files change
- **Intelligent Insights**: Receive suggestions for improvements, potential bugs, and optimization opportunities
- **Integration with BGRun**: Load insights directly into your coding environment as you work
- **Contextual Awareness**: Make LLMs aware of O3's higher-level insights about your codebase

#### Implementation Plan

1. Create a daemon script that watches for file changes or runs on a schedule
2. Periodically collect relevant files based on configurable rules
3. Submit to O3 with analysis-focused prompts (different from refactoring prompts)
4. Parse and store insights in a structured format
5. Expose insights via API or file interface for integration with coding tools

This will create a feedback loop where your most capable model (O3) continuously analyzes your code in the background, while your everyday coding assistant remains aware of these insights.

### BGRun Integration

We've implemented integration with the BGRun tool to make O3's code analysis insights available directly to LLMs during your coding sessions:

- **Automatic Widget Creation**: O3 insights appear as widgets in your `.windsurfrules` file
- **Scheduled Analysis**: Set custom intervals for background code analysis (hourly, daily, etc.)
- **Contextual Awareness**: Your LLM assistant automatically sees the insights when coding

#### Usage

```bash
# Setup automated analysis with default settings (4-hour interval)
./o3r_bgrun_integration.sh

# Analyze only Python files in src directory every 12 hours
./o3r_bgrun_integration.sh -d ./src -e py -i 12h

# Run once and show current insights
./o3r_bgrun_integration.sh -1 -s
```

#### Options

- `-d DIR` - Project directory to analyze (default: current directory)
- `-e EXTS` - File extensions to analyze (default: py,js,ts,go)
- `-i INTERVAL` - Check interval like 30m, 4h, 1d (default: 4h)
- `-n MAX` - Maximum number of files to analyze at once (default: 10)
- `-w NAME` - Custom widget name (default: o3r-insights)
- `-s` - Show current insights without starting analysis
- `-1` - Run analysis once and exit (no background monitoring)

#### How It Works

1. The integration script uses `o3r_analyze.sh` to periodically analyze your code
2. Analysis results are formatted into concise summaries
3. BGRun creates or updates a widget in `.windsurfrules` with the insights
4. Your LLM coding assistant automatically sees these insights during your coding sessions

This creates a seamless experience where O3's powerful analytical capabilities continuously inform your everyday coding assistant.
