0. CRITICAL: ALWAYS USE PROPER CODE FENCING! Every code snippet MUST be wrapped in triple backticks (```) with the appropriate language specified. Example: ```swift [code goes here] ``` - This is THE MOST IMPORTANT requirement as it ensures proper parsing and execution.

8. NAME TRANSITION: Replace all occurrences of "VoiceInk" with AppConfig.appName to support transition to "VibeRater" while maintaining flexibility for future changes.

9. MAINTAIN API COMPATIBILITY: Ensure that all public interfaces, UserDefaults keys, and external APIs remain compatible with existing code that might reference them.

10. CENTRALIZE SETTINGS: Use AppSettingsManager for all settings access - remove any direct UserDefaults references throughout the codebase.

11. HANDLE PREFIX CHANGES: Ensure identifiers like file prefixes, logger subsystems, and bundle identifiers are updated consistently.

12. SETTINGS SEPARATION: Maintain separation between VoiceInk and VibeRater settings, allowing both apps to coexist if needed.

13. MIGRATION SUPPORT: Include appropriate migration logic for users upgrading from VoiceInk to VibeRater.

14. UPDATE DOCUMENTATION: Ensure code comments, docstrings, and README files reflect the new app name.
